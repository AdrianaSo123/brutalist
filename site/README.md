# Neo-Brutalism Design Gallery

A comprehensive design gallery showcasing the Neo-Brutalism style—a fusion of 1950s architectural brutalism with 1990s web design aesthetics. Built as part of the Swiss Design Lineage project for IS 373 - Building Web Applications.

## 🎨 About This Project

This website demonstrates authentic Neo-Brutalist design principles:
- **Brutalist foundation**: Raw aesthetics, exposed structure, honest materials
- **90s web nostalgia**: Blocky layouts, bold borders, early internet simplicity
- **Bold colors**: Bright primaries and high-contrast combinations (vs. brutalism's gray)
- **Intentionally raw**: Deliberately unpolished but carefully designed

## 🎯 Design Principles Implemented

### Color Palette
- **Primary**: Black (#000000) and White (#FFFFFF)
- **Accent**: Bright Yellow (#FFFF00)
- **Approach**: High contrast, no gradients, no subtle tones

### Typography
- **Fonts**: System fonts (Arial, Helvetica) for authenticity
- **Style**: ALL CAPS headings, bold and chunky
- **Hierarchy**: Extreme size contrast (96px to 16px)
- **Approach**: Quirky allowed, but keep body text readable

### Layout
- **Borders**: 4-5px thick black borders (key neo-brutalist trait)
- **Corners**: Sharp 90° angles (no border-radius)
- **Shadows**: Hard offset shadows (8px 8px 0 #000, no blur)
- **Grid**: Blocky, geometric, structured but raw

### Spacing
- **Philosophy**: Tight and packed, intentionally cramped
- **Padding**: Minimal (creates tension)
- **Approach**: Rejects generous Swiss white space

### Interactions
- **Transitions**: None (instant state changes)
- **Hovers**: Hard shifts, no smooth fades
- **States**: Obvious and abrupt

## ⏱️ Time Log

| Phase | Time | Activities |
|-------|------|-----------|
| Research & Planning | 1.5 hours | Style guide study, project setup, research |
| Design System | 2 hours | CSS implementation, component design |
| Content Creation | 4 hours | 5 pages with historical/theoretical content |
| Responsive Design | 1 hour | Mobile/tablet optimization |
| Documentation | 1 hour | Collaboration story, README |
| **Total** | **~9.5 hours** | End-to-end with AI collaboration |

## 🎓 Key Learnings

### Design Insights
- **Neo-brutalism is distinct from brutalism**: More colorful, structured, nostalgic
- **Intentionality matters**: Neo-brutalism is deliberately designed, not accidentally ugly
- **Balance boldness with UX**: NN/g research shows accessibility must remain priority
- **90s nostalgia + modern polish**: Best of both eras

### Technical Decisions
- System fonts reduce load time and embody anti-corporate ethos
- Thick borders make structure visible (truth to materials)
- Hard shadows create depth without subtle blur
- No transitions keep interactions immediate and honest
- Tight spacing creates tension characteristic of the style

### Collaboration Process
- AI handled implementation while following strict style guide
- Every design choice justified against Neo-Brutalist principles
- Responsive design maintained rough aesthetic while ensuring usability
- Content balanced historical accuracy with accessibility
