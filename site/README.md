# Neo-Brutalism Design Gallery

A comprehensive design gallery showcasing the Neo-Brutalism style, from its architectural origins in the 1950s to its modern digital revival. Built as part of the Swiss Design Lineage project for IS 218 - Building Web Applications.

## 🎨 About This Project

This website demonstrates authentic Neo-Brutalist design principles:
- **Raw aesthetics**: Thick borders, harsh angles, stark colors
- **Honest structure**: Exposed grids, visible elements
- **Anti-corporate**: Deliberately unrefined, rejecting polish
- **Functional minimalism**: Only what's needed, nothing decorative

## 🎯 Design Principles Implemented

### Color Palette
- **Primary**: Black (#000000) and White (#FFFFFF)
- **Accent**: Bright Yellow (#FFFF00)
- **Approach**: High contrast, no gradients, no subtle tones

### Typography
- **Fonts**: System fonts only (Arial, Helvetica, Courier)
- **Style**: ALL CAPS headings, tight line-height (1.2-1.3)
- **Hierarchy**: Extreme size contrast (72px to 16px)

### Layout
- **Borders**: 4-5px thick black borders around all sections
- **Corners**: Sharp 90° angles (no border-radius)
- **Shadows**: Hard offset shadows (8px 8px 0 #000)
- **Grid**: Exposed and obvious structure

### Spacing
- **Philosophy**: Tight and packed, intentionally cramped
- **Padding**: Minimal (creates tension)
- **Approach**: Rejects generous Swiss white space

### Interactions
- **Transitions**: None (instant state changes)
- **Hovers**: Hard shifts, no smooth fades
- **States**: Obvious and abrupt

## 🎓 Key Learnings

### Design Insights
- **Intentionality matters**: Brutalism is deliberately rough, not accidentally ugly
- **Constraints breed creativity**: Limiting to system fonts and stark colors forced innovative solutions
- **Honesty is aesthetic**: Exposed structure has visual power without decoration

### Technical Decisions
- System fonts reduce load time and embody anti-corporate ethos
- Thick borders make structure visible (truth to materials)
- Hard shadows create depth without subtle blur
- No transitions keep interactions immediate and honest
- Tight spacing creates tension characteristic of the style

### Collaboration Process
- AI handled implementation while following strict style guide
- Every design choice justified against Neo-Brutalist principles
- Responsive design maintained rough aesthetic while ensuring usability
- Content balanced historical accuracy with accessibility
